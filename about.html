          As a digital media artist, I have a vast knowledge in many types of
          mediums in the digital realm. But the main medium I like to work with
          is web design specifically combing web design with glitch art. My
          style of work is close to what abstract artist would do but in this
          instance in web design. I prefer to make work that looks interesting
          and has no meaning to it, something that will catch someone attention
          or keep them looking through the website. As I have started leaning
          more about web design, I have also gotten fascinated in interactive
          art through websites. Growing up I played many videos games and
          because of this it has made me want to make work where people can
          interact with my work. Not specifically games but web art that will
          get someone hooked to explore the website. In video games there is
          something called an “Easter Egg” where player look around to uncover
          secrets, I want to get have this same felling but through a website in
          the future. Web art is perfect for this because as technologies
          advance so does the medium and new art will come out of it. For the
          mean time glitching work in my eyes has been one of the ways where it
          can catch someone eyes and be interested in the work. The reason for
          that because even when I glitch something you can see the residues of
          the old image so people will try to figure out what the image was
          before it was glitched. I want my art to abstract and to get people to
          interact with it. As we move forward with technology many artworks are
          going to be more accessible and I want my art to be like that from the
          start.
