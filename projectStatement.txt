Statement

For this website I decided to go with a darkmode version because for me it is something that is better on the eyes and to me it looks better. To combine with that color I wanted to use a shade that was similar to my background color but just a bit lighter so it can standout. I used red highlight effects on certain things because I noticed that lot of my work has red in it and I though it would make my website feel like it is connected to my work through color. For the home page I wanted the layout to be simple with my code art on there to make the page feel interactive but at the same time simple. The same could be said for my about page and my artwork pages I did not want the website to distract from my work so I did not use a lot of elements on those pages. For my gallery page I had a little more fun I wanted this page to be interactive and at the same time make my images look professional. The layout I chose is something Iâ€™ve been wanting to do for awhile. I wanted the images to be close to each other but at the same time have the images be on a grid that no matter the dimensions of the image the grid still looked symmetrical.
